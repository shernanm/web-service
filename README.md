## First steps

#### Installing node

Get the latest version of node from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/) or using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
Nvm approach is preferred.

#### Getting dependencies

Run `npm install` or `yarn` from rootpath of the project.

#### Starting your app

Now, we have two ways to start an app. To start your app in production mode run `npm start` in the root path of your project. To start your app in development mode (nodemon) run `npm run start-dev`. Then access your app at **localhost:port**. The port is logged in the console where you ran the start script.
